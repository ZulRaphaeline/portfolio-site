                Say hello to the perfection of Cybele- tall, gorgeous, millionaire. Sheâ€™s a supermodel by day and a kidnapper extraordinaire at night. When she took Princess Talia from the castle one night, the whole country was sent into
                chaos.
              </p>
              <p>Princess Talia was the only successor to the throne, and her absence baffled the kingdom. Nobody knew that Cybele was the culprit, and no one would be able to guess her reason for it. Only she knew.</p>
              <p>Watch Cybele, both our hero and villain for the story as she struggles to fulfill her wishes while trying to keep her feelings for the Princess in check.</p>

              <p>"Let go of me you mongrel!"</p>
              <p>
                I watched in fascination as the princess struggled against the ropes binding her ankles and wrist. She shook on the floor like a worm, her head twitching in different directions once in a while, no doubt searching for her
                captor, even whilst it was covered with a black cotton pillowcase.
              </p>
              <p>"Unhand me buffoon and I'll tell my mother the queen to spare your life," she said indignantly.</p>
              <p>
                Oooh! How lovely. As if her mother the queen could help her right now. This one was charming. It almost made me want to let go of her. Ha ha! As if. All that planning to infiltrate the castle and kidnap her would not go to
                waste. But while she was in my possession, I might as well have a little fun with her.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I doubt your highness will spare my life if I let you go," I said to her. She stopped squirming in an instant. "You're a girl?" she asked with bathed breath. The corner of my mouth perked up into a smirk. "Last time I
                checked yes," I told her.
              </p>
              <p>
                "What do you want from me? Do you want money? Power? Men? I can give you all of that." She tried to sit but it was too much of an effort, considering she was bound like that. I stifled a smile. "I have money," I said. "Lots
                of it in fact. Power comes with money, so that is not an issue. As for men. Well let's just say that I like women more."
              </p>
              <p>"Then what do you want?" she asked in a small voice. I walked steadily to her and kneeled on the floor. Once I did, I brought her to a sitting position and leaned to her head so I could whisper. "I want your body."</p>

              <p>
                She froze in an instant and squirmed away from me. "You're a lunatic! Jerk! You're an ugly son of a-" I removed the cover on her head and watched her mouth slack open as she blinked in a confused daze at me. I heard her
                breath hitch as she took a good look at my face. We studied each other for a while.
              </p>
              <p>Her gray eyes took in my features. She licked her thin lips nervously and asked, "What color are your eyes. They are the strangest green."</p>
              <p>
                I smirked at her. "They're called forest green princess." Before she could ask another question, I took her in my arms and hauled her to the bedroom. It was not without difficulty of course. She kept wriggling against me and
                even threatened to bite me. What a charming princess, I thought in disdain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we were inside the bedroom, which would be her holding room or her cell if you want to call it that, I set her down on the bed where she squirmed some more. I looked her in the eyes. "If you want me to untie you, you'll
                stop twitching like that. You look like a maggot."
              </p>
              <p>"I am not!" she said heatedly. I clicked my tongue at her. "Sure you're not princess."</p>
              <p>
                She stared daggers at me. "Why did you kidnap me? You're a low life! You're the lowest!" she seethed. I gave her a patronizing look. "And you're a saint princess?" I asked with a smile. "Don't ask questions that you'll
                regret knowing the answer to."
              </p>
              <p>"Are you going to kill me?" she choked.</p>
              <p>
                "If I wanted to, I would have done it a long time ago. So to answer your question, no I'm not going to kill you. But I am going to hold you here for a long time. Look around you princess. Stare at the four corners of this
                room because you'll get to memorize it while you're here."
              </p>
              <p>
                I pointed to the windows. "Those are barred. Even if you cut that lovely honey colored hair of yours to make a Rapunzel-like rope, you'll never escape from here." I tilted my chin to the door where she followed with her
                gaze. "That is made with metal and is locked with a security code that only I know of."

                "Scream all you want," I continued. "This hideout is located miles from any town or road. No one will ever hear you. In this little world of ours, I'm your only friend. I will feed you, talk to you when I want to, and do
                things that need be. If you're not nice to me, you'll never see the daylight again. Do you understand?"
              </p>
              <p>"I despise you," she said savagely.</p>
              <p>"Well I'm very sorry to hear that," I said with a shrug. "But your attitude will not help you at all princess." I stood up and walked to the door.</p>
              <p>"Wait!" she called out. "Aren't you going to remove my restraints?"</p>
              <p>Her question made me smile to myself. "Say please," I said. Her jaw clenched. "Are you freaking kidding me?" she said loudly.</p>
              <p>
                "I don't think her highness would appreciate your smart mouth princess." I faced her and grinned widely. "I'll only remove that if you say please." She closed her eyes for an instant and deliberated whether to say it or not.
                She thought better of it and said, "Please remove it."
              </p>
              <p>
                I walked back to her and leaned down so I could untie the ropes. "See? I know there's some manners left in you," I teased. She pursed her lips and didn't reply. I knew she was angry at me for kidnapping her and doing this.
                But who cares? I had my own reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                My hands deftly removed the knots on the rope. Once she was untied, the princess moved her hands around and sat on the edge of the bed. She stunned me by elbowing my stomach and running to the direction of the door. Years of
                judo training kicked in. I pounced on her and pinned her to the ground where I straddled her.
              </p>
              <p>"You shouldn't have done that," I told her. "My stomach is going to bruise. You're lucky that I don't have a photo shoot right now." She writhed against my grip. "What are you saying? Let me go this instant!"</p>
              <p>
                "I'm warning you princess. If you do that again, I'll rip your clothes off and let you stay here completely naked." That made her stop. "When I release you, you're going to walk back to the bed. Understand?" She nodded. I
                stood up and helped her to her feet. She headed to the direction of the bed and sat down as instructed.
